    </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have a working NestJS application. If you don't, follow the [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/) to create one first.

## Installation

### Core Package

Add the NestJS tRPC package to your existing project:

```bash
npm install @nexica/nestjs-trpc@1.0.0-dev.36
```

### Required Dependencies

Install the tRPC server and validation library:

```bash
npm install @trpc/server zod
```

Note: `@nestjs/common` and `@nestjs/core` are already installed in your NestJS project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have NestJS tRPC installed:

1. **[Configuration](/docs/configuration)** - Configure the TRPCModule in your app
2. **[Create Your First Router](/docs/decorators/router)** - Build your first type-safe API
3. **[Understanding Context](/docs/context)** - Learn about request context and dependency injection
